A "**foundation**" in openFyde is where we keep reusable and shared assets, they usually form a foundational layer to a family of hardware devices. 

Often a foundation is made towards a family or a specific model of SoC, all devices in openFyde having this (family of) SoC will then be able to inherit from this foundation.

This repository has the foundation for the [RK3399 SoC](https://www.rock-chips.com/a/en/products/RK33_Series/2016/0419/758.html).

## Contents

We store packages that are reused across multiple hardware devices that share similarities in a foundation. Specifically, this usually includes `chipset` and `baseboard`:

 - a `chipset` is a special overlay that consists of necessary configuration scripts and required packages for the corresponding SoC itself. This usually includes media codecs (under media-libs), Mali GPU User-Space drivers and necessary Linux kernel patches.
 - a `baseboard` is a special overlay that has most of the common packages needed for all openFyde devices as well as a family of devices sharing similar design principles. For example, `baseboard-rockpi4` contains software packages needed for openFyde under all Rock Pi 4 variants (Rock Pi 4B, Rock Pi 4C Plus and etc.).
